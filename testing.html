   <p>I am a broadly trained anthropological archaeologist whose research explores the intersection of landscape and political ecology. I am currently an assistant professor of Anthropology at James Madison University. Using a combination of environmental archaeology methods such as geospatial analysis, geochemical analysis, starch grain analysis, and archival research, I investigate how landscape constrains and provides opportunities for collective action, such as the rise of states, coordinated rebellions, and the emergence of new group identities in South America. My research highlights the key role that social landscapes—the organization of social relations over the landscape—play in facilitating collective struggles to control one’s own labor, ritual landscape, and ecological resources.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am pursuing several distinct collaborations. The first is continuing an experimental archaeology and lithic analysis of Tiwanaku-style arrowheads to understand state formation. I was able to engage students in the experimental archaeology part of this project as a part of their independent studies. The second is a research collaboration with Sonia Alconini of the University of Virginia exploring archaeological influences on neo-Andean architecture in El Alto, Bolivia. The third is a digital humanities project in collaboration with Jeremy Mikecz and Alan Farahani digitizing historical censuses and creating an open-source tool that allows for the visualization of kinship networks, demographic data, and landscapes of surname similarity. The fourth is a collaboration with Katherine Chiou (University of Alabama), Kylie Quave (George Washington University), Jordi Rivera (Brown University), Andrew Warnes (Leeds), and Psyche Williams-Forson (University of Maryland), and others, on food archaeology and intersectionality.</p>
<p>	I am also working through analyzing and writing up past data collection on ancient Chincha balance beams (with Jordan Dalton of SUNY Oswego), Spanish colonial court cases, Spanish labor institutions (with Sarah Kennedy of Carleton College and Maria Smith of Syracuse), and the chronology of Inka labor institutions.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>My overarching pedagogical ethos is to prepare students to be exemplary citizens of the world through mastering critical thinking, developing practical skills, and learning how to collaborate with each other to co-create knowledge. I strive to show students what they are learning in class is relevant to their contemporary hopes, frustrations, and anxieties. My training has been in the social sciences, and I view myself primarily as an archaeologist who engages with larger social science debates and methodologies, both quantitative and qualitative. I also bring a more humanistic component to teaching with my training in cultural anthropology and history. I teach my students from this broad base, exposing them not only to the subfields of anthropology, but also to history, political science, and sociology. I teach them the different approaches to the same phenomena or data that the different social science fields take, so that they become comfortable with recognizing differing epistemologies. To aid students in transition from the “one true narrative” style of learning from their high schools to college-level critical reasoning, my pedagogical philosophy emphasizes not just what we know, but how we know. I also make them aware of different ways of knowing the world that are not grounded in the social and physical sciences, exposing them to diverse ontologies such as Quechua materiality and North American Indigenous understandings of history.</p>
<p>I do not view assessments as a way of measuring intrinsic skill, but as a way of helping students gain enthusiasm for improving their critical thinking and practical skills, which helps them in their other coursework and in life. I believe that an integral part of critical thinking is to give students the authority to challenge authority intelligently, including my own. In class discussions, I would often present to them something I have hypothesized or written, and ask them to find flaws in it. This not only helps student-professor rapport, but teaches them to avoid the logical fallacy of appeal to authority. I model myself after the clerk in the Canterbury Tales by Chaucer, “Gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.” I stress to my students that every class is an exercise in learning together and creating knowledge together. Breaking down that barrier has helped give students the sense that our classroom is a safe space to voice opinions. 
</p>
    <p>I believe that teaching and research can have positive feedback loops. The students’ creativity and class discussions have helped me think critically about the research I am doing and see data in new ways. I encourage students to question received narratives in a methodical manner, including my own. It helps me broaden the significance and accessibility of my research and anticipate counterarguments. Most importantly, the students engage with methods of critical reasoning in a safe learning environment.
My courses foster cooperation and the feeling that the class is in it together on a journey toward more knowledge. I was nominated by students for the Madison Vision teaching award and nominated for the Goodman award in Spring of 2024.</p>
 <p>In sum, my teaching philosophy rests on four principles. First, if students own their learning by creating, rather than just memorizing, knowledge, they are more motivated to do well and retain critical thinking skills. To this end, I assign research papers, grant proposals, and creative assignments (art and fiction). Second, by using a Socratic method that relies on scaffolding, or gradual introduction of ever more complex ideas, students are less likely to be frustrated by complex social theory and more likely to put facts into larger conceptual frameworks on their own. Lecture or Canvas reading modules are reserved for providing the students the basic toolkit and factual knowledge to tackle complex problems. Thus, students can spend more in-class time building sophisticated connections between data and theory instead of being asked basic questions about facts from the readings. Third, in-class group activities such as role-playing and debates can create a friendly and productive competitive environment. Fourth, I believe that it is important to emphasize the contemporary significance of the archaeological case studies reviewed in class, so that students can see that similar social processes played out in the past and present. This is to help them become informed citizens to recognize and resist maladaptive social and ecological processes. </p>

    Below are some of the substantive praise I have received from students:</p>
