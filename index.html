<p><font size="20">Hi!</font> I recently obtained my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley with the 

dissertation entitled “Labor under the Sun and the Son: Landscapes of Control and Resistance at Inka and Spanish Colonial Pomacocha, Ayacucho, Peru.” The 

thread that runs through all my research is how civil society and the state interact, especially through strategies of control and resistance. My research 

themes are identity, labor, and landscape in the Andes, especially under states (Tiwanaku, Inka, and Spanish).
<p>
I am proficient in several archaeological 

methodologies: lithic analysis, spatial analysis (Geographic Information Systems and Space Syntax), and Spanish colonial paleography. I also have experience in 

the analysis of other kinds of archaeological materials: ceramics, faunal remains, and botanical remains. My overall focus on social landscapes brings together 

diverse lines of evidence. For example, I integrate lithic analysis, geochemical analysis, and starch grain analysis to understand the social relationships 

relating to food and trade over the wider landscape. 
<p>
My dissertation research, supported by Fulbright-Hays, Wenner-Gren, and the Ford Foundation, examined 

the nature of social movements in the context of colonialism. It investigated the long-term social conditions that enabled the conjuncture of local armed 

revolts and regional-scale rebellions in the late Spanish colonial period in Peru, through a combination of archaeological and historical evidence. The 

dissertation aimed to understand the effect of Inka and Spanish colonial institutions of labor on identity and social cohesion. The primary case study was a 

village called Pomacocha, located in Vilcashuamán province in the modern region of Ayacucho, Peru. Pomacocha was intensely affected by both Inka and Spanish 

colonialism and provides rare insight into the lives of the people whose labor sustained these colonial regimes. 
<p>
I have two active research projects, one 

short-term and one long-term, planned. The short-term project, entitled “War or peace? Assessing the rise of the Tiwanaku state through experimental 

archaeology and projectile point analysis,” is in collaboration with Bruce Bradley of the University of Exeter, UK. This project is an outgrowth of my past 

research on the lithics of the Taraco Archaeological Project directed by Christine Hastorf and Maria Bruno, and I presented the preliminary results of the 2016 

laboratory analysis season at WAC8, Kyoto and published a preliminary report in the journal <i>Lithics</i>. The experimental archaeology component of the 

project is being carried out with Bruce Bradley; currently, we are in the process of knapping replicas of Tiwanaku and non-Tiwanaku projectile points for 

comparison. The long-term research project is tentatively entitled “Social landscapes of cooperation and conflict in Vilcashuamán province on the eve of Inka 

conquest.” The project will involve an archaeological survey of the Late Intermediate Period <i>pukaras</i>, or hilltop fortresses, of Vilcashuamán province to 

map the competitive social landscape shortly before the arrival of the Inka. Vilcashuamán later became an important provincial center for the Inka as well as 

the area with the earliest and most intensive implementation of the <i>mitmaqkuna</i>, or transplanted colonists, program. According to ethnohistoric sources, 

most of the original ethnic groups were expelled from the area, with the exception of a group called the Tanquihua, to make room for transplanted 

<i>mitmaqkuna</i>. Understanding why some groups, but not others, were expelled from the area is critical to understanding Inka imperial strategies of conquest 

and state consolidation.
