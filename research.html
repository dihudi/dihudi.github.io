<h3>1. Title: <i>War or Peace? Assessing the Rise of the Tiwanaku State Through Experimental Archaeology and Projectile Point Analysis</i></h3>
	    <h4> <table align="right"><tr><td><img src="wymer4.jpg" align="right" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td width="300"><h5><i>Examples of serrated Tiwanaku-style projectile points from the Taraco Archaeological Project.</i></h5></td></tr></table>Abstract: A common assumption about warfare is that it is a necessary component of state formation. However, recent research in the southern Titicaca Basin showed a lack of inter-group violence and warfare during early multi-community polity formation, the precursor to state formation. This project traces the evolution of multi-community polity formation in the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia, before and during the rise of the Tiwanaku state through the analysis of projectile points from the Taraco Archaeological Project. As Tiwanaku’s influence rose, the ceremonial centers of the Taraco peninsula declined in importance. Did Tiwanaku’s early rise involve violent expansion?
Experimental recreation of Tiwanaku and non-Tiwanaku projectile points will enable comparisons of how the formal properties affect function.

<h3>2. Title: <i>The Co-evolution of Latin American Prisons and Colonial Capitalism </i></h3>
		<h4><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="obraje.JPG" align="right"></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><h5><i>Intervisibility in the textile workshop of Pomacocha.</i></h5>
			</td></tr></table>Description: This research project will explore the relationship between architecture and the organisation of social relations in the development of capitalism in Latin America. During the course of my thesis research, I became intrigued by how the textile workshops of Latin America physically resemble prisons more than factories. They practically functioned as prisons because the workers were most often debt slaves or criminals serving a sentence. Richard Salvucci, in <i>Textiles and Capitalism in Mexico</i>, argued that contrary to popular belief, textile workshops were not proto-factories. According to Salvucci, the textile workshops represented an economic evolutionary dead end parallel to, and not part of, the development of capitalistic factories. While I agree with Salvucci that the colonial Latin American textile workshops did not operate under free market principles, I believe that Latin American textile workshops and capitalistic factories shared the same social logic. In the same vein as Foucault and Marx, I believe that capitalism is undergirded by innovations in methods of social control that engineer a docile, alienated workforce. Such methods of control and social engineering preceded the rise of capitalism, but according to Foucault, only with the Enlightenment did such techniques of the body begin to pervade all aspects of society and reinforce one another. I argue that the textile workshops were laboratories where the methods of control and production of “docile” bodies converged. 
		<p><h4>I should like to use the lens of prisons to explore the connections among the development of European capitalism and the architecture of control and confinement. More specifically, I should like to compare the spatial syntax of Latin American textile workshops to eighteenth to mid-nineteenth century prisons—particularly those employing prison labor—in England and the United States. I want to understand how social difference was spatially produced and reproduced in these institutions, which is critical to comparing the practical effects of these institutions. Archival research on the influences of the architects and policy makers related to the prisons should clarify if the practical similarities and differences among US and English prisons and Latin American textile workshops stem from common intellectual inspirations.  So far, discussion of Latin American textile workshops and prisons is isolated from broader conversations about the global exchange of ideas concerning social control and reform through labor.  </h4></p>

<h3>3. Title: <i>Social Landscapes of Cooperation and Conflict in Vilcashuamán Province on the Eve of Inka Conquest</i></h3>
		<h4><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="pucaras.jpg" align="right"></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><h5><i>Geographic distribution and size of pukaras of Vilcashuamán province as surveyed by satellite and aerial imagery.</i></h5>
			</td></tr></table>Description: The project will involve an archaeological survey of the Late Intermediate Period <i>pukaras</i>, or hilltop fortresses, of Vilcashuamán province to map the competitive social landscape shortly before the arrival of the Inka. According to ethnohistoric sources, a <i>Chanka</i> ethnic group called the Vilca, among other ethnic groups, inhabited Vilcashuamán province. The core Vilcashuamán area may have had groups that were organized enough to pose a serious threat to the Inka. Bauer et al. (2010: 91) argued that the ethnohistoric narratives emphasizing the sophistication of Chanka society were false, because the Chanka settlement pattern in the neighboring Andahuaylas province, with multiple centers and smaller settlements than those in Cuzco, demonstrated little “ethnic integration, class formation, and the development of a regional political hierarchy during the Late Intermediate Period.”  The <i>pukaras</i> in the core Vilcashuamán area, however, were much larger overall than those in Andahuaylas: seven out of twenty-eight pucaras in the core Vilcashuamán area were larger than 15ha, and the largest two, Pillucho and San Lorenzo, were, conservatively estimated, around 50ha in area. Although larger than hilltop and ridgetop settlements in Andahuaylas, those in the Vilcashuamán core area do not demonstrate a centralized hierarchy due to the presence of multiple, comparably large settlements. Vilcashuamán later became an important provincial center for the Inka as well as the area with the earliest and most intensive implementation of the <i>mitmaqkuna</i>, or transplanted colonists, program. According to ethnohistoric sources, most of the original ethnic groups were expelled from the area, with the exception of a group called the Tanquihua, to make room for transplanted <i>mitmaqkuna</i>. Understanding why some groups, but not others, were expelled from the area is critical to understanding Inka imperial strategies of conquest and state consolidation. Did the Inka use a competitive social landscape to their advantage or were the <i>pukara</i> settlements of Vilcashuamán province cooperative?
		</h4>
		<h4> This multi-year project has the following components:
			<br>
			<li> Archaeological and aerial/satellite photography survey to identify all <i>pukaras</i> of the modern province of Vilcashuamán.
			<li> Mapping representative well-preserved <i>pukaras</i> of different size classes to understand how social space was organized at the settlement level, e.g., moiety divisions. Attributes of each <i>pukara</i> will be used to plot matrices of similarity, which could reveal functional or cultural differences. If funds permit, a LIDAR survey is preferred given the remoteness and large size of many <i>pukaras</i>.
				<li> The collection of ceramic and obsidian artifact samples to understand economic networks among the <i>pukara</i> settlements.
			<li> Test pit excavations in a sample of <i>pukaras</i> to establish settlement chronology.

<h3>1. Title: <i> Labor under the Sun and the Son: Landscapes of Control and Resistance at Inka and Spanish Colonial Pomacocha, Ayacucho, Peru</i></h3>
<img src="PAPC_logo.gif" width="300" align="right"><h4> Abstract:  Why do the oppressed not rebel, especially when they outnumber their oppressors? What are the social conditions for armed rebellion? Should we be focusing on armed rebellion rather than other kinds of resistance? This dissertation examines these general questions about the nature of social movements in the context of Spanish colonialism. Specifically, it unpacks the long term social conditions that enabled the conjuncture of local armed revolts and regional-scale rebellions in the late colonial period (late eighteenth/early nineteenth century) in Peru through a combination of archaeological and historical evidence. The primary case study is a village called Pomacocha, located in Vilcashuamán province in the modern region of Ayacucho, Peru.
By putting an important case study “under the microscope,” we can examine how
local social conditions influenced regional social conditions for revolt and vice versa. Pomacocha was intensely affected by both Inka and Spanish colonialism and provides rare insight into the lives of the people whose labor sustained the colonial regimes. It  began as a transplanted colony of agriculturalists (
mitmaqkuna
) to supply food for the nearby Inka palace and the Inka provincial capital of Vilcashuamán (Willka Wamán).  After the Spanish conquest, the agricultural settlement at Pomacocha was abandoned. Later, an
hacienda
-
obraje
 was established and a new native community sprang up around it. The area became a politically and economically important zone for the Spaniards. How did the materiality of social relations inform strategies of resistance by exploited laborers in the Andean village of Pomacocha? Historical documents attest to the poor working conditions and abuses at the textile workshop of Pomacocha during the Spanish colonial period, but no significant armed uprising occurred until after the Tupac Amaru II rebellion of 1781. To understand and contextualize the short-term and long-term causes of the late colonial upheaval, I analyze the long-term evolution of strategies of control and resistance at Pomacocha, starting with the Inka period. I combine archival research, archaeological excavations and surveys, analysis of material
culture, surname analysis of censuses, and space syntax analysis to show that strategies of state control and bottom-up resistance coevolved from the Inka period, and that this coevolution resulted in a social landscape conducive to alliances across social groups in the late colonial period. There has been little archaeological work aimed at understanding the relationship between forms of resistance and the materiality of social relationships of coerced laborers in the Inka and Spanish colonial periods. By understanding the effect of Inka and Spanish colonial institutions of labor on identity and social cohesion, we gain a better understanding of the motivations, enabling social conditions, and strategies of resistance to such institutions. By taking a long-term view of how the  workers of a single community negotiated strategies of control of labor, my dissertation fleshes out a typical case study of the interplay among local motivations and wider social context for general rebellion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

<b>Table 1</b>: Titicaca Basin Chronology
(after Bandy 2004 and <span class=SpellE>Hastorf</span> 2008)
<br>
	<br>
	Through ceramic
analysis and archaeological survey, others have shown that multi-community
polities with their own stylistic and ceremonial traditions arose in the Middle
Formative (Bandy 2004, 2006; Frye and Steadman 2001; <span class=SpellE>Hastorf</span>
2008; Steadman 1995, 1999). These important demographic and political
transitions imply changes in the economy. This project analyzed the <span
class=SpellE>lithics</span> of <span class=SpellE>Chiripa</span> to understand
changes in procurement of raw materials and production during this important
transition. The two main questions were:
<br>
	<br>
1) Does the transition between
the Early Formative and the Middle Formative reflect in significant changes in
lithic production?
<br>
	<br>
2) What artifact types co-occur
and how do these relationships change over time?
<br>
	<br>
A
total of 1950 <span class=SpellE>lithics</span> excavated from dated and
minimally disturbed contexts from the site of <span class=SpellE>Chiripa</span>
were analyzed to address the questions. The <span class=SpellE>lithics</span>
were excavated by the <span class=SpellE>Taraco</span> Archaeological Project
from 1992 to 2006.
<br>
	<br>
Most artifact classes showed
significant changes that are consistent with increased nucleation of the
different production stages as well as consumption and use of <span
class=SpellE>lithics</span>. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Ceremonially,
<span class=SpellE>Chiripa</span> became an ever more important center for
people to gather and celebrate in Middle Formative (<span class=SpellE>Hastorf</span>
2003; <span class=SpellE>Hastorf</span> et al. 2001). What is interesting is
that the analysis of the <span class=SpellE>Chiripa</span> <span class=SpellE>lithics</span>
suggests that the character of the gatherings may have also changed in Middle
Formative. Because the nucleation of ceremonialism was an ongoing process since
the Early Formative I, whereas nucleation of lithic production and use was most
evident in the Middle Formative, it appears that the nucleation of
ceremonialism actually preceded nucleation of productive activities like lithic
production and agricultural production. This suggests that innovations in
ceremonialism preceded innovations in the economy for the people who gathered
at <span class=SpellE>Chiripa</span>, which is consistent with <span
class=SpellE>Hastorf’s</span> (2003: 327) original thesis: “As the events grew
more elaborate, they opened up the possibility to expand control in other
realms, perhaps with ownership of lake resources, fields, or herds.”
Ceremonialism preceding nucleation of productive activities may explain why we
see monumental ceremonial architecture absent domestic and agricultural
evidence elsewhere in the early Andes. A possible explanation is that as the
gatherings became more regular, frequent, and involving more people, a critical
tipping point was reached in both population size and level of cooperation,
	leading to innovations in lithic production.</h4>

<h4> Description: <table align="right"><tr><td><img src="kuft.jpg" align="right" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td width="300"><h5><i>Examples of flake tools from Kala Uyuni (Taraco Archaeological Project).</i></h5></td></tr></table>The lithics of Kala Uyuni have great potential in understanding the changes in daily practice over time, especially as Tiwanaku gained hegemony.  The lithics of the 2009 season were analyzed to understand household production and consumption at Kala Uyuni.  The lithic technology of domestic contexts is still not well understood on the Taraco Peninsula in the Late Formative transition into Tiwanaku era.  The author hopes to contribute to understanding how daily life may have changed in this important transition through the lens of lithics. 
<br>
	<br>
This project focused on how the character of daily life changed from the Late Formative I to the Late Formative-Tiwanaku transition through the lens of lithics: 
<li>1)	How spatially prescribed was lithic production at Kala Uyuni?  How did lithic production change over time?</li>
	<li>2)	Can we see evidence of intensification in certain kinds of lithic production?</li>
<li>3)	Were there additions in the suite of domestic lithic activities, and what are the economic and ritual implications of such innovations?
	</li>
	<li>4)	Was there long distance exchange of raw materials or were raw materials locally acquired and reduced?</li>
<br>
	<br>
Generally, daily life through lithics did not change significantly over time at Kala Uyuni. Two notable exceptions, however, was the increasing production and/or use of quicklime and the presence of serrated edges on flake tools.

<h3>4. Title: <i>Chincha Material Culture from the Max Uhle Collection, Phoebe Hearst Museum</i></h3>
<h4> Description: This project examined scale beams and stone artifacts of the Chincha peoples of the Late Intermediate Period (1100-1476 A.D.) and the Late Horizon (1476-1532 A.D.).  The collection of scale beams and stone artifacts of probable ritual function are housed in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology and was excavated by Max Uhle in September to December of 1900 in the Chincha valley of Peru.  Kroeber and Strong’s (1924) monograph on Uhle’s Chincha collection skipped description of the stones entirely, so this project would fill in important gaps.  This study represents the systematic analysis of the largest archaeological collection of Chincha balance beams and probable ritual stone artifacts.
