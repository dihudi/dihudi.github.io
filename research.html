<h3>1. Title: <i>War or Peace? Assessing the Rise of the Tiwanaku State Through Experimental Archaeology and Projectile Point Analysis</i></h3>
<h4> <img src="wymer4.jpg" align="right" width="350">Abstract: A common assumption about warfare is that it is a necessary component of state formation. However, recent research in the southern Titicaca Basin showed a lack of inter-group violence and warfare during early multi-community polity formation, the precursor to state formation. This project traces the evolution of multi-community polity formation in the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia, before and during the rise of the Tiwanaku state through the analysis of projectile points from the Taraco Archaeological Project. As Tiwanaku’s influence rose, the ceremonial centers of the Taraco peninsula declined in importance. Did Tiwanaku’s early rise involve violent expansion?
Experimental recreation of Tiwanaku and non-Tiwanaku projectile points will enable comparisons of how the formal properties affect function.

<h3>2. Title: <i>Social Landscapes of Cooperation and Conflict in Vilcashuamán Province on the Eve of Inka Conquest</i></h3>
<img src="pucaras.jpg" align="left">
		<h4> Description: The project will involve an archaeological survey of the Late Intermediate Period pukaras, or hilltop fortresses, of Vilcashuamán province to map the competitive social landscape shortly before the arrival of the Inka. According to ethnohistoric sources, a <i>Chanka</i> ethnic group called the Vilca, among other ethnic groups, inhabited Vilcashuamán province. the core Vilcashuamán area may have had groups that were organized enough to pose a serious threat to the Inka. Bauer et al. (2010: 91) argued that the ethnohistoric narratives emphasizing the sophistication of Chanka society were false, because the Chanka settlement pattern in the neighboring Andahuaylas province, with multiple centers and smaller settlements than those in Cuzco, demonstrated little “ethnic integration, class formation, and the development of a regional political hierarchy during the Late Intermediate Period.”  The hilltop and ridgetop settlements (pukara) in the core Vilcashuamán area, however, were much larger overall than those in Andahuaylas: seven out of twenty-eight pucaras in the core Vilcashuamán area were larger than 15ha, and the largest two, Pillucho and San Lorenzo, were, conservatively estimated, around 50ha in area. Although larger than hilltop and ridgetop settlements in Andahuaylas, those in the Vilcashuamán core area do not demonstrate a centralized hierarchy due to the presence of multiple, comparably large settlements. Vilcashuamán later became an important provincial center for the Inka as well as the area with the earliest and most intensive implementation of the mitmaqkuna, or transplanted colonists, program. According to ethnohistoric sources, most of the original ethnic groups were expelled from the area, with the exception of a group called the Tanquihua, to make room for transplanted mitmaqkuna. Understanding why some groups, but not others, were expelled from the area is critical to understanding Inka imperial strategies of conquest and state consolidation. Did the Inka use a competitive social landscape to their advantage or were the <i>pukara</i> settlements of Vilcashuamán province cooperative?
		</h4>
		<h4> This multi-year project has the following components:
			<br>
			<li> Archaeological and aerial/satellite photography survey to identify all <i>pukaras</i> of the modern province of Vilcashuamán.
			<li> Mapping representative well-preserved <i>pukaras</i> of different size classes to understand how social space was organized at the settlement level, e.g., moiety divisions. Attributes of each <i>pukara</i> will be used to plot matrices of similarity, which could reveal functional or cultural differences. If funds permit, a LIDAR survey is preferred given the remoteness and large size of many <i>pukaras</i>.
				<li> The collection of ceramic and obsidian artifact samples to understand economic networks among the <i>pukara</i> settlements.
			<li> Test pit excavations in a sample of <i>pukaras</i> to establish settlement chronology.

<h3>1. Title: <i> Labor under the Sun and the Son: Landscapes of Control and Resistance at Inka and Spanish Colonial Pomacocha, Ayacucho, Peru</i></h3>
<h4> Abstract:  Why do the oppressed not rebel, especially when they outnumber their oppressors? What are the social conditions for armed rebellion? Should we be focusing on armed rebellion rather than other kinds of resistance? This dissertation examines these general questions about the nature of social movements in the context of Spanish colonialism. Specifically, it unpacks the long term social conditions that enabled the conjuncture of local armed revolts and regional-scale rebellions in the late colonial period (late eighteenth/early nineteenth century) in Peru through a combination of archaeological and historical evidence. The primary case study is a village called Pomacocha, located in Vilcashuamán province in the modern region of Ayacucho, Peru.
By putting an important case study “under the microscope,” we can examine how
local social conditions influenced regional social conditions for revolt and vice versa. Pomacocha was intensely affected by both Inka and Spanish colonialism and provides rare insight into the lives of the people whose labor sustained the colonial regimes. It  began as a transplanted colony of agriculturalists (
mitmaqkuna
) to supply food for the nearby Inka palace and the Inka provincial capital of Vilcashuamán (Willka Wamán).  After the Spanish conquest, the agricultural settlement at Pomacocha was abandoned. Later, an
hacienda
-
obraje
 was established and a new native community sprang up around it. The area became a politically and economically important zone for the Spaniards. How did the materiality of social relations inform strategies of resistance by exploited laborers in the Andean village of Pomacocha? Historical documents attest to the poor working conditions and abuses at the textile workshop of Pomacocha during the Spanish colonial period, but no significant armed uprising occurred until after the Tupac Amaru II rebellion of 1781. To understand and contextualize the short-term and long-term causes of the late colonial upheaval, I analyze the long-term evolution of strategies of control and resistance at Pomacocha, starting with the Inka period. I combine archival research, archaeological excavations and surveys, analysis of material
culture, surname analysis of censuses, and space syntax analysis to show that strategies of state control and bottom-up resistance coevolved from the Inka period, and that this coevolution resulted in a social landscape conducive to alliances across social groups in the late colonial period. There has been little archaeological work aimed at understanding the relationship between forms of resistance and the materiality of social relationships of coerced laborers in the Inka and Spanish colonial periods. By understanding the effect of Inka and Spanish colonial institutions of labor on identity and social cohesion, we gain a better understanding of the motivations, enabling social conditions, and strategies of resistance to such institutions. By taking a long-term view of how the  workers of a single community negotiated strategies of control of labor, my dissertation fleshes out a typical case study of the interplay among local motivations and wider social context for general rebellion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
